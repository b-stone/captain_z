## Captain Z

Full name: Captain Sophia Zephyr

Captain of the ship the Wind Drinker.

### Backstory

Captain Z is 22 years old. An orphan. She was born in the Port of Goodnews, and was cared for by Dr. Star at her orphanage/school since the age of 3.

### Description

Here is the description of her face, from the book:

The little lamp she held gave a glimpse of her face. A jagged scar ran across it. Starting at the left ear, it painted a crooked Z across her cheek, ending at her nose. She held up a map for a closer look at the markings on it.

Her mouth was turned down in a deep frown of concentration. Her eyes looked like two pieces of coal, black and smoldering, as they stared down at the scrap of paper.

She also wears a feathered hat of some sort - something piratey.

## The Dread Captain Spears

Captain of the ship the Sea Breaker.

### Description

Glowing eye:

Of course this is to say nothing of Captain Spears's evil red eye.

Some people said it was a magic eye, and could kill a man with only a glare. Others said that Spears was cursed by a foul witch, and the eye was markings of that spell. Others said that he couldn't see a wink out of it at all, a blindness caused by a run in with a poisonous jellyfish when he was just a child.

No one knew who was right or wrong about Captain Spears and his eye. But it did seem to glow in the night, like the flame from a candle. And at times it changed color, from red to yellow, or even blue. 

The eye only added to the fearfulness other pirates felt when they spoke of Captain Spears.

### Crew and Cat

Hissy is his cat.
