## Captain Z

Full name: Captain Sophia Zephyr

Captain of the ship the Wind Drinker.

### Backstory

Captain Z is 22 years old. An orphan. She was born in the Port of Goodnews, and was cared for by Dr. Star at her orphanage/school since the age of 3.

### Description

Here is the description of her face, from the book:

> The little lamp she held gave a glimpse of her face. A jagged scar ran across it. Starting at the left ear, it painted a crooked Z across her cheek, ending at her nose. She held up a map for a closer look at the markings on it.

> Her mouth was turned down in a deep frown of concentration. Her eyes looked like two pieces of coal, black and smoldering, as they stared down at the scrap of paper.

She also wears a feathered hat of some sort - something piratey.

### Muddle the Crow

Her pet trained crow. 

From the book:

> Captain Z had rescued the crow when it was just a baby. Blown out to sea and tossed among the waves, Captain Z had found the little Muddle in an empty bread basket. She raised her on fish, clams, and shrimp, and had taught it all manner of tricks and skills.

> The name Muddle came from the crows bad luck. It just as often messed things up as make them better, but Captain Z loved her just the same.



## The Dread Captain Spears

Captain of the ship the Sea Breaker.

### Description

He's older, perhaps 50, with a beard. Traditional pirate look.

Glowing eye:

One of his eyes glows red, and can change color depending on his mood.

From the book:

> Of course this is to say nothing of Captain Spears's evil red eye.

> Some people said it was a magic eye, and could kill a man with only a glare. Others said that Spears was cursed by a foul witch, and the eye was markings of that spell. Others said that he couldn't see a wink out of it at all, a blindness caused by a run in with a poisonous jellyfish when he was just a child.

> No one knew who was right or wrong about Captain Spears and his eye. But it did seem to glow in the night, like the flame from a candle. And at times it changed color, from red to yellow, or even blue. 

> The eye only added to the fearfulness other pirates felt when they spoke of Captain Spears.

The eye allows Spears to see in the dark. It also can zoom in like a telescope or microscope.

Old Jon Thumb: older man. Missing one of his thumbs.

Sally Snake Eye: middle aged woman. Only one eye.
